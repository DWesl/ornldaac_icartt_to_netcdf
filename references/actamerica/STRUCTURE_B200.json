However, in some cases, names have been changed  (e.g., to eliminate duplication)  Units have been standardized throughout the merge. Contact michael.shook@nasa.gov with any questions as to which data was included.",

    "summary": "This dataset provides three merged data products acquired during flights over the central and eastern United States as part of the Atmospheric Carbon and Transport - America (ACT-America) project. Two aircraft platforms, the NASA Langley Beechcraft B200 King Air and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's C-130H Hercules, were used to collect high-quality in situ measurements across a variety of continental surfaces and atmospheric conditions. The merged data products are composed of continuous in situ measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and ethane (C2H6, B200 aircraft only) that were averaged to uniform intervals and merged with trace gas concentrations from discrete flask samples collected with the Programmable Flask Package (PFP) and the aircraft navigation and meteorological variables. These merged data products provide integrated measurements at intervals useful to the modeling community for studying the transport and fluxes of atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane across North America.",
